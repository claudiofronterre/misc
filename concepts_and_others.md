# Statistical and scientific concepts

## We buy information with assumptions (Coombs, 1964)
Before one starts any investigation, one should have in mind some question that one wants to answer. This sounds so obvious as not to be worth stating, but sadly it seems often to be ignored in many research endeavours. The motto, 'If it moves, measure it', characterizes an unfortunately large proportion of what has passed for research in several disciplines. In the short term, following this motto allows one to seem and feel busy, but in the longer term, it is a recipe for disappointment. But having said that, it is not always easy to decide on a question. It takes a little thought. It takes a little theory. As Coombs (1964: 5-6) has put it: 'All knowledge is the result of theory - we buy information with assumptions - "facts" are inferences, and so also are data and measurement and scales . . . there is no necessary interpretation of any behavioral example as some particular kind of data. With the unspoken corollary that what is bought may or may not give good value.

## Statistics and scientific method
“Far better an approximate answer to the right
question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to
the wrong question, which can always be made precise.”
John Tukey (1915–2000)

“...the importance of making contact with the best
research workers in other subjects and aiming over a
period to establish genuine involvement and
collaboration in their activities.”
Sir David Cox, FRS (b 1924)

Implications for training scientists:
- teach statistical thinking, not statistical techniques;
- how to recognise when standard methods are inadequate;
- the statistician as an integral (and committed!) part of the research team.
