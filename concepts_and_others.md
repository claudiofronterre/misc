## We buy information with assumptions (Coombs, 1964)
Before one starts any investigation, one should have in mind some question that one wants to answer. This sounds so obvious as not to be worth stating, but sadly it seems often to be ignored in many research endeavours. The motto, 'If it moves, measure it', characterizes an unfortunately large proportion of what has passed for research in several disciplines. In the short term, following this motto allows one to seem and feel busy, but in the longer term, it is a recipe for disappointment. But having said that, it is not always easy to decide on a question. It takes a little thought. It takes a little theory. As Coombs (1964: 5-6) has put it: 'All knowledge is the result of theory - we buy information with assumptions - "facts" are inferences, and so also are data and measurement and scales . . . there is no necessary interpretation of any behavioral example as some particular kind of data. With the unspoken corollary that what is bought may or may not give good value.
