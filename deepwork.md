# Deep Work

## Ritualize 
- **Where you'll work and for how long:** need to specify a location for my deep work efforts. Maybe going to a quiet place in the library could to conduct exclusively deep work could help?
- **How you'll work once you start to work:** my ritual needs rules and processes to keep my efforts structured. Maybe institute a ban on internet usage? Or no email? 
- **How you'll support your work:** brain needs support to keep operating at an high level of depth. Maybe start with a cup of tea and bring energy bar and similar with you.
