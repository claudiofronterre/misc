# My Workflow

## Projecy directory set up
The project directory should have the following structure:
* The data folder contains all input data (and metadata) used in the analysis.
* The doc folder contains the manuscript.
* The figs directory contains figures generated by the analysis.
* The output folder contains any type of intermediate or output files (e.g. simulation outputs, models, processed datasets, etc.). You might separate this and also have a cleaned-data folder.
* The R directory contains R scripts with function definitions.
* The reports folder contains RMarkdown files that document the analysis or
report on results.

## File naming

Hence the final prject folder should look something like

## Version control
### Git workflow
Every time that you change something in the local directory to update the git-hub repo do:
```
git status
git add -A #add all changes
git commit -m "a message to remember the updates"
git push
```
